# Challenge
Build a matching service using Express! My idea came from my adoration of the @notallgeminis instagram account: astrology memes. Using a survey, the app determines who you are most compatible with based on if you agree or disagree with 10 @notallgeminis memes.

# User Guide

" target="_blank"><img src="./app/public/assets/images/rihanna.png" 
alt="rihanna meme" width="300" height="250" border="10" /></a>

Here's how it works:

- Click on Start
- Interpret and analyze each meme
- Use the horizontal scale from left to right, left being completely disagree and right being completely agree, to describe your judgment of each meme
- Have fun!

The game uses basic concepts in express and other node modules, so it's a good way to practice express for the first time!
